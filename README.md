Raymond Smullyan has designed many puzzles involving Knights and Knaves. Knights always tell the truth,
whereas Knaves always lie. We refer to Knights and Knaves as Sirs. A puzzle, which is a set of English sentences,
involves a finite number of Sirs.



A sentence starts with a capital letter and ends in a full stop, an exclamation mark,
or a question mark, possibly followed by closing double quotes. Sir, Sirs, Sir names, Knight and Knave always
start with a capital letter, and no other word inside a sentence is capitalised. A sentence in a puzzle contains
at most one part enclosed between double quotes. When a sentence contains one part enclosed between double
quotes, the part outside the double quotes contains a single occurrence of the form Sir Sir_Name, and what
occurs between the double quotes is something said by Sir Sir_Name. A sentence that contains no part enclosed
between double quotes might refer to a number of Sirs, always in the form Sir Sir_Name, or Sirs Sir_Name_1
and Sir_Name_2, or Sirs Sir_Name_1, Sir_Name_2, …and Sir_Name_n, where n ≥ 3, and Sir_Name_1, …,
Sir_Name_n are pairwise distinct.
