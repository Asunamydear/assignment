Raymond Smullyan has designed many puzzles involving Knights and Knaves. Knights always tell the truth,
whereas Knaves always lie. We refer to Knights and Knaves as Sirs. A puzzle, which is a set of English sentences,
involves a finite number of Sirs.A sentence starts with a capital letter and ends in a full stop, an exclamation mark,
or a question mark, possibly followed by closing double quotes.
